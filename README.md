This is a Read Me for my final game in Game dev, which is a game about Alice and Marcy. Marcy is an older generation of robotic park ranger and is in charge of taking care of the park until one day Alice, a small but mighty is separated from her owners. 
Marcy programmed only to do mundane tasks, breaks code to do anything to get Alice back to her owners.
